## Required Components

* **[index.html](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/master/apk-generator/index.html)** A html file which can server as the landing page for your server.
* **[runPy.php](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/master/apk-generator/scripts/runPy.php)** A php script that will launch python script by taking input from index.html.
* **[appgenserver.py](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/master/apk-generator/scripts/appgenserver.py)** A python script containg commands to compile and generate the app
* **[clone.sh](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/master/apk-generator/scripts/clone.sh)** A bash script used for cloning the source code for android app onto the server.
* **[buildApk.sh](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/master/apk-generator/scripts/buildApk.sh)** A bash script used for initiating the app's build and signing it once the app has been generated.
* **[email.php](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/master/apk-generator/api/email.sh)** A php script used to send the email containing the generated app as an attachment.
* **[upload.php](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/development/apk-generator/scripts/upload.php)** A php script that will upload the json zip that is chosen by the user into a unique folder based on his timestamp.<br>  **[api.php](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/development/apk-generator/api/api.php)** A php script that serves as an API and handles incoming requests to the server.
* **[copyapk.sh](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/development/apk-generator/scripts/copyApk.sh)** A bash script that will copy the generated and signed apk to the release folder in `public-html` of the server.
* **[cleanup.sh](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/development/apk-generator/scripts/cleanup.sh)** A bash script that will delete all the signed apks from the release folder in `public-html` of the server. This is to be run as a cronjob using the command ``` crontab 01 00 * * * root Path_to_cleanup.sh ``` where 01 00 means it'll run at 1.00 AM every night and will execute cleanup.sh.

## Server Setup

1) Navigate to server's `/var/www/` and install the Android SDK here.

2) You can do that by following this [thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17963508/how-to-install-android-sdk-build-tools-on-the-command-line/) on stackoverflow.

3) Edit the .bashrc file located in /root to reference to the SDK you have just installed

* To do this, type in `nano /root/.bashrc` and press enter.<br>
  Navigate to the bottom of the file that opens and add following code there<br>
  `export ANDROID_HOME=/var/www/android-sdk-linux`<br>
  `export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools`

4) Download the template app icon that is to be used during compilation if user hasn't provided us with any logo.<br>
  `sudo apt-get install wget`<br>
  `wget image_link_here`

5) Move all the files mentioned in the `scripts` folder (Except `runPy.php`, `upload.php` and `index.html`) into `/root/scripts`.

6) Move `runPy.php`, `upload.php`, and `index.html` to `/var/www/html`

7) [Install and setup](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04) JAVA on your machine.

8) Next, install PHP.This can be done by simply writing `sudo apt-get install php` in your terminal.

* Now modify the maximum upload limit of php to atleast `500MB`. (Default is 2MB)
* You need to set the value of ```upload_max_filesize``` and ```post_max_size``` in your ```php.ini``` file. <br> ```php.ini``` file should be located in ```/etc/php/7.0/fpm/php.ini```:

```sh
; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 500M

; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize
post_max_size = 500M
```

9) Modify your sudoers list to allow www-data to run the runPy.php script as root

* You can do this by typing the following command `sudo visudo` and hitting enter<br>
* Next scroll to the bottom of the file and add `www-data ALL = NOPASSWD: /var/www/html/runPy.php`

10) Create a [firebase account](firebase.google.com) and add your API key to index.html<br>

* Navigate to your Account and then create a new project (Name it whatever you want)<br>
* Open this newly created project and click the Pink colored button saying _"Add Firebase to your web app"_<br>
* Copy the code listed there and paste it to [index.html](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/master/apk-generator/index.html#L76) Also add your server's IP address to trusted sources in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/app-generator/authentication/providers) by clicking on _Add Domain_

11) Create another folder in your public-html named `api` and move contents of the folder `api` here.

12) The sender's address, message title and the body of email is defined in `conig.json` inside `apk-generator/scripts`. Changing this will affect the email that is sent.
